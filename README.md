# Tollbooth-system
The Automatic Tollbooth System is built around the Arduino Uno microcontroller, which acts as the central control unit. The system typically includes sensor such as ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicles approaching the toll plaza.When a vehicle approaches the tollbooth, the sensor detects its presence and the  Arduino controls a servo motor to open the barrier, allowing the vehicle to pass without stopping.
 Additionally, an LCD display can show relevant information such as number of vechicals passed through the tollbooth
